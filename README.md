## Project Synopsis
We're building CuteQueue, an office hours queue platform with the primary goal of integrating the queue into the student's learning experience. Our focus is on enhancing visual design, facilitating collaboration between students, and scaffolding requests—before, during, and after being helped—all to improve student self-efficacy.
